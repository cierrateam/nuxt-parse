# How to contribute
We welcome everyone to submit pull requests with:
- issue fixes
- change suggestions
- documentation updates

However, not every pull request will automatically be accepted. We will review each carefully to make sure it is in line with
 the direction we want the package to continue in. This might mean that some pull requests are not accepted, or might stay
 unmerged until a place for them can be determined.


## Submitting changes
When submitting a pull request, it is important to make sure to complete the following:
- [ ] Add a descriptive header that explains in a single sentence what problem the PR solves.
- [ ] Add a detailed description with animated screen-grab GIFs or screenshots visualizing how it works.
- [ ] Explain why you think it should be implemented one way vs. another, highlight performance improvements, etc.

## Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.
- This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
- Emphasis readability of code over patterns to reduce mental debt
- Always add an empty line around structures (if statements, loops, etc.)

Thanks!
